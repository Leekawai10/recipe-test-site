  <p><strong>Broccoli is the star ingredient in this twist on pesto pasta that's reminiscent of a pasta bake with its crunchy crumb topping, but without the oven time.</strong></p>
  <p>Healthy, dairy-free and freezable, it ticks so many boxes, making it a versatile and vibrant midweek meal.</p>

  <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>375g head of broccoli, cut into florets, stalk cut into 1-2cm pieces</li>
    <li>320g frozen peas</li>
    <li>100g pumpkin seeds</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, 2 crushed, 1 thinly sliced</li>
    <li>30g pack fresh basil</li>
    <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
    <li>300g wholewheat spaghetti</li>
    <li>220g pack green beans, trimmed and halved</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 red chilli, sliced</li>
    <li>6 tbsp (40g) dried breadcrumbs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook the broccoli stalk and peas in a large pan of boiling water for 3-4 mins until the broccoli is tender. Scoop into a colander with a slotted spoon, run under cold water and drain. Reserve the cooking water and set aside.</li>
    <li>Toast the pumpkin seeds in a dry frying pan for 3-4 mins until golden. Tip into a food processor with the crushed garlic, basil, and lemon zest and juice, then blitz to combine.</li>
    <li>Cook the spaghetti to pack instructions in the reserved cooking water, adding the broccoli florets and green beans for the last 4 mins of cooking. Drain, reserving a mug of the cooking water.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, add the broccoli stalk and peas to the food processor and blitz again, slowly adding 2 tbsp olive oil and 100-120ml water while the motor is running, to make a thick, slightly chunky pesto. Season to taste.</li>
    <li>Heat the remaining 1 tbsp oil in the frying pan over a low-medium heat. Fry the sliced garlic and chilli for 1-2 mins until the garlic just starts to turn pale golden, then add the breadcrumbs. Fry for another 1-2 mins until golden and crisp; tip into a bowl.</li>
    <li>Stir the pesto through the pasta and vegetables, loosening with a little of the reserved cooking water if needed. Spoon into bowls and top with the spicy breadcrumbs to serve.</li>
